# Read This!

This is a simple web app with the sole purpose of sharing links with people close to you. No more will the very important and awesome links you get share get forgotten in a chat thread. Setup some logins (in Firebase), associate account IDs with some usernames (see database-example.json), and start sharing! 

Select who you want to share with, provide the URL and some additional context if you think it'd be helpful. Filter by new, all or seen. Delete links that you're done with and keep others around to look at again later. 

## Powered By...
