This is a simple web app with the sole purpose of sharing links with one other person. No more will the very important and awesome links you get share get forgotten in a chat thread. Select one of two profiles, see links shared with you and directly share a link with the other user. 

There is currently no login or accounts system as it was not needed for our purposes. So if you need that, have at it. The whole thing is probably in pretty rough shape but I'm not a JS dev, haven't ever used Firebase or React before so I can only assume there is immense room for improvement.

## Powered By...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses Firebase as the backend.

Favicons and other icon stuff generated with [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). 

Also happily using [Bootstrap 4.1.1](http://getbootstrap.com).

## How Do
`npm install` install all the dependencies

`npm start` to run a local server

`npm run build` to create a production buld
